# Analysis-of-cars-dataset
Primary purpose: We create charts and plots to get better overview of the data in less amount of time. And to create charts and plots we do EDA.
Hence Exploratory Data Analysis is for deeper understanding of the data. 
By using EDA we can easily understand how strong and weak relationship is there in between the data.
